            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Prophet Muhammad, born in 570 CE in Mecca (modern-day Saudi Arabia), is considered the last prophet in Islam. Here are some key details about his early life:

### 1. **Birth and Family**
   - Muhammad was born into the **Hashemite clan** of the **Quraysh tribe**, one of the most prominent tribes in Mecca.
   - His father, **Abdullah**, died before he was born, leaving him an orphan from birth.
   - His mother, **Amina**, died when he was just six years old, making him doubly orphaned. He was raised by his grandfather, **Abdul Muttalib**, and after his grandfather’s death, by his uncle, **Abu Talib**.

### 2. **Early Childhood and Upbringing**
   - Raised in relative poverty after his father’s death, Muhammad’s early years were marked by hardship. However, he was cared for with love and affection by his grandfather and uncle.
   - As a child, he was known for his honesty and integrity, earning the nickname **Al-Amin** (The Trustworthy) due to his reputation for fairness and reliability.

### 3. **Youth and Work**
   - In his late teens, Muhammad worked as a **merchant**, traveling on trade caravans. He gained valuable experience and wisdom in this role.
   - His work took him to places such as **Syria**, where he came into contact with different cultures and religious beliefs.
   - Around the age of 25, Muhammad began working for a wealthy widow named **Khadijah bint Khuwaylid**, who was 15 years older than him. She was impressed by his honesty and business acumen, and they eventually married.

### 4. **Marriage to Khadijah**
   - Their marriage was a successful and loving one, and Khadijah was supportive of Muhammad throughout his life. They had four daughters and two sons together, although their sons died young.
   - Khadijah was the first person to accept Muhammad’s prophethood when he received the first revelation at the age of 40.

### 5. **Spiritual Life**
   - As a young man, Muhammad was deeply reflective and often retreated to a cave in **Mount Hira** near Mecca to meditate. It was during one of these retreats, in 610 CE, when he received the first revelation from the angel **Gabriel** (Jibril in Arabic), marking the beginning of his prophethood.

### 6. **Revelation and Early Message**
   - After receiving the first revelation, Muhammad began preaching the message of monotheism — the belief in one God, **Allah**. His message was met with resistance from many Quraysh leaders, who feared it would disrupt their power and influence in Mecca.

This period of his early life laid the foundation for the spread of Islam, which would later become a global religion.

            <h2>Prophethood</h2>
            <p>
                Prophet Muhammad's prophethood marks a pivotal moment in the history of Islam and the broader world. Here are key details about his mission and prophethood:

### 1. **First Revelation (610 CE)**
   - At the age of 40, Muhammad received the first revelation from the angel **Gabriel** (Jibril) in the cave of **Hira** near Mecca. The first words revealed were **“Read! In the name of your Lord who created…”** (Quran 96:1), signaling the beginning of his mission as the last prophet.
   - This revelation came during a time when Muhammad was deeply contemplative and spiritually inclined, seeking solitude in the cave.

### 2. **Initial Reactions and Support**
   - Initially, Muhammad shared his revelation only with his closest family and friends. His first follower was his wife, **Khadijah**, who believed in him and supported his mission.
   - His cousin, **Ali ibn Abi Talib**, and his friend, **Abu Bakr**, also embraced his message early on, becoming key supporters.

### 3. **Preaching in Mecca**
   - Muhammad began preaching publicly about the oneness of **Allah** (God) and the importance of justice, mercy, and compassion.
   - The message emphasized moral and ethical living, social justice, and caring for the poor, orphans, and the marginalized.
   - Muhammad’s teachings were met with intense resistance from the Quraysh leaders, who saw his message as a threat to their power, status, and the economic prosperity of Mecca, which was a religious center at the time.

### 4. **Persecution and Opposition**
   - As the message of Islam spread, opposition to Muhammad intensified. The Quraysh leaders and elite began to persecute his followers, subjecting them to torture, ridicule, and economic sanctions.
   - Despite the harsh persecution, Muhammad continued to preach, with several early converts facing social ostracism.
   - The opposition grew more hostile, and the Quraysh leaders attempted to buy Muhammad’s silence by offering him wealth, power, and status, but he refused, insisting that his message was a divine mission and could not be compromised.

### 5. **The Night Journey (Isra and Mi’raj)**
   - In a miraculous event known as **Isra and Mi’raj**, Muhammad is said to have been taken on a night journey from Mecca to **Jerusalem** and then ascended to the heavens. 
   - During this journey, he met previous prophets, including **Abraham, Moses, and Jesus**, and received instructions for the Muslim community, including the **five daily prayers** (Salah).
   - This event confirmed Muhammad’s prophethood and reinforced his mission, despite the increasing opposition.

### 6. **The Migration (Hijrah) to Medina (622 CE)**
   - Due to escalating persecution in Mecca, in 622 CE, Muhammad and his followers migrated to the city of **Yathrib** (later named **Medina**), a pivotal event known as the **Hijrah**.
   - In Medina, Muhammad’s role expanded from being a spiritual leader to also becoming a political and military leader. He mediated disputes, established a society based on Islamic principles, and organized the first Muslim community.
   - The migration to Medina marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

### 7. **Establishing the Muslim Community in Medina**
   - In Medina, Muhammad formed a pact between the various tribes, including the **Ansar** (the local Muslims) and the **Muhajirun** (the emigrants from Mecca), to ensure peace and cooperation.
   - He established the **Constitution of Medina**, which was a set of agreements between the Muslim and non-Muslim communities, creating a pluralistic society based on mutual respect and shared governance.
   - He also built the **first mosque** in Medina, known as the **Prophet’s Mosque**.

### 8. **Conflicts and Battles**
   - The Muslims faced several military conflicts with the Quraysh and other tribes, including the battles of **Badr** (624 CE), **Uhud** (625 CE), and the **Battle of the Trench** (627 CE). The Muslims won a significant victory at Badr, but suffered a setback at Uhud.
   - Despite the challenges, the Muslim community grew in strength and influence.

### 9. **Conquest of Mecca (630 CE)**
   - In 630 CE, after years of tension and treaties, Muhammad and his followers marched to Mecca with an army of 10,000. Mecca surrendered peacefully, and the idols in the Kaaba were destroyed, symbolizing the triumph of monotheism.
   - Muhammad forgave many of his former enemies, including the leaders of the Quraysh, marking his victory with mercy and reconciliation.

### 10. **Final Years and the Last Sermon**
   - After the conquest of Mecca, Islam spread rapidly across the Arabian Peninsula. Many tribes embraced Islam, and the Muslim community continued to grow.
   - In his final years, Muhammad delivered his **Farewell Sermon** during the **Hajj** pilgrimage in 632 CE, where he outlined key principles for his followers: equality, justice, and the importance of upholding the Quran and his teachings.
   - Shortly after this sermon, Muhammad fell ill and passed away in June 632 CE at the age of 63. He was buried in the **Prophet’s Mosque** in Medina.

### 11. **Legacy**
   - Muhammad is regarded as the **Seal of the Prophets**, the final messenger of Allah, and his teachings, as recorded in the **Quran** and his sayings (Hadith), form the foundation of Islamic faith and law.
   - Islam spread rapidly after his death and became one of the largest religions in the world.

Muhammad’s prophethood fundamentally changed the course of history, creating a religious and political movement that continues to influence billions of people around the world today.

            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>
                Prophet Muhammad’s death, which occurred in 632 CE, marked the end of his earthly life and the conclusion of his mission as the final messenger of Allah. Here are the key details surrounding his death:

### 1. **Illness Before His Death**
   - In the month of **Safar** (around late May to early June) in 632 CE, Muhammad fell ill. He experienced a fever and weakness, which grew progressively worse over several days.
   - Despite his illness, Muhammad continued to lead the Muslim community. He presided over prayers (though on some occasions, he asked **Abu Bakr**, his close companion and the future first caliph, to lead the prayers in his place).
   - During this time, he spent much of his final days in the home of his wife **Aisha** in **Medina**.

### 2. **The Farewell Pilgrimage**
   - Before falling seriously ill, Muhammad performed his **Farewell Hajj** (pilgrimage) in 632 CE. This pilgrimage was highly significant, as it marked the completion of his mission. During the pilgrimage, he delivered his famous **Farewell Sermon**, in which he outlined essential principles of Islam, emphasizing justice, equality, and the importance of the Quran and his teachings.
   - The sermon was an expression of his final guidance to the Muslim community, urging them to treat each other with respect, maintain the rights of others, and adhere to the principles of Islam.

### 3. **His Last Days and the Final Moments**
   - As Muhammad’s illness worsened, he was unable to lead prayers and instructed Abu Bakr to take his place as the prayer leader. This was a significant act, as it indicated Abu Bakr’s leadership role in the community.
   - On his deathbed, Muhammad’s family and companions gathered around him. He expressed concern for the well-being of the Muslim community and for the guidance of the people after his passing.
   - Muhammad was reported to have said, **“I am leaving among you two precious things: the Book of Allah and my Sunnah (traditions). If you follow both, you will never go astray.”** This statement further emphasized the importance of adhering to the Quran and his teachings after his death.

### 4. **His Passing**
   - Muhammad passed away on **June 8, 632 CE**, at the age of 63, in the presence of his wife Aisha. He died after a brief illness that lasted several days.
   - Upon his death, Aisha’s house, where he passed away, was filled with mourning and sorrow. His death deeply affected his companions and the early Muslim community, as they had lost their leader and guide.

### 5. **Burial**
   - Muhammad’s funeral arrangements were carried out swiftly. He was buried in the room of his wife Aisha, which was adjacent to the **Prophet’s Mosque** in Medina. His grave remains in the mosque, and it has become a place of reverence for Muslims worldwide.
   - According to Islamic tradition, the funeral was attended by a number of close companions, though there were no grand ceremonial rites. The simple burial reflects the humble life that Muhammad led.

### 6. **Aftermath and Succession**
   - Muhammad’s death left the Muslim community in a state of mourning, but it also raised the question of succession. The community faced a crucial decision about who would lead after him.
   - **Abu Bakr**, one of Muhammad’s closest companions and the person Muhammad had trusted to lead prayers in his final days, was selected as the **first caliph** (successor). His selection marked the beginning of the **Rashidun Caliphate** and the continuation of the Islamic state after Muhammad's death.

### 7. **Legacy**
   - Prophet Muhammad’s death did not bring an end to the message of Islam. His teachings, recorded in the **Quran** and **Hadith**, continue to guide Muslims in all aspects of life.
   - His death marked the end of the line of prophets, and Muslims regard him as the **Seal of the Prophets**, affirming that no other prophets will come after him.
   - The Islamic faith, under the leadership of his successors, rapidly expanded across the Arabian Peninsula and beyond, becoming one of the world’s major religions.

Muhammad’s passing was a moment of great sorrow for his companions, but it also marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Islam, as his followers sought to preserve and spread his message.
